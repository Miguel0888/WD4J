# Where do I find the API?
- The API is located in the com.microsoft.playwright package. The API is a subproject of the main project. The API contains the original Playwright Java interfaces. They might be moved to a  (gradle) subproject in the future.
- The implementation classes from PlayWright are left out for purpose. They are the basis of the adapter library found in the wd4j package.
