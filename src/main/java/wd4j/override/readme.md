# PlayWright initially was not developed with WebDriver BiDi in mind!
Instead, they used Chrome DevTools. Therefore the interfaces had to be changed to fit the WebDriver BiDi API naming convention. It is just a hint to avoid confusion. It has not functional impact: You still have to call context() instead of session() for example.

The original PlayWright API is located in the com.microsoft.playwright package. The API is a subproject of the main project. The API contains the original Playwright Java interfaces. They might be moved to a  (gradle) subproject in the future. The implementation classes from PlayWright are left out for purpose. They are the basis of the adapter library found in the wd4j package.
